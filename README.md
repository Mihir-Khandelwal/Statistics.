# Statistics.
## Discriptive Statistics.
- Mode: It is the number which occurs most frequently in the data series. It is robust and not affected by the couple of new values.

--------
- Mean: It is the average of the numbers in the data series. It is not robust.

--------
- Median: The absolute central value of the data series is called median.

-----
- Outliers: Any value will fall really outside the range of the data is termed as a outlier.
  - Reasons for Outliers in the data.
1. Typos.
2. Measurement error.
3. Intentional error.
4. Legit outliers.
- Mean gets affected by Outliers while Mode not.
### Spread of Data.
- Spread of Data describes how similar or varied are the set of observations.

-----
1. Range: The difference between the smallest and largest values is called range. The bigger the range the more spread out is the data. It is not very robust metric to calculate spread of data. It takes the entire data into consideration.

------
2. Inter Quartile Range(IQR): It is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. It is not affected by just a few outliers in the data. It takes 50% of the data into consideration.

------
3. Variance: It is the average squared deviations from the mean. The formula is given below.

-----
4. Standard Deviation: It is the square root of variance.

- Frequency Table: A table representing frequency or a count of a category.
------
- Probability: Number of changes a particular event will occur.

### Bernoulli Trials.
- An experiment which has exactly two outcomes. Probability distribution of the number of successes in 'n' Bernoulli Trials is called as Binomial Distriburtion.

- p = probability of winning.
- 1-p = q = probability of loosing.
- n = number of times an event occur.
- k = number of times of winning.

### Continuous Random Variable.
- They can take any value in a given range. Probability distribution of a continuous random variable is known as Probability Density Function.
- Example: Life of a fly, i.e. 4-6 days.

### Central Limit Theorem.
- If we take means of random samples from a distribution and we plot the means, the graph approaches to a normal distribution when we have taken sufficiently large number of such samples. The theorem aslo states, that the mean of means will be approximately equal to the mean of the sample means.

------
### Normal Distribution.
1. Area under the probability density function gives the probability fro the random variable to be in that range.
2. There is the large probability for the means to be around the actual mean of the data, than to be farther away.
3. Normal Distribution for higher standard deviations are flatter as compared to those for lover standard deviations.
- To convert Normal Distribution to a standard normal curve, replace frequencies with probabilities, so that the area under the curve is 1.

### Empirical Rule.
The Empirical Rule states that almost all data lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean for a normal distribution.
1. Under this rule, 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation.
2. 95% of the data lies within two standard deviations.
3. 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations.
4. Totral area under the standard normal curve is 1.

------
### Z Score.
The distance in terms of numbers of standard deviation, the observed value is away from the mean, is the standard score or the Z score.
- If 'Z' value is positive it means it is right of the mean, and if 'Z' value is negative it is to the left of the mean.

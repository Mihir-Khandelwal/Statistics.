# Statistics.
## Discriptive Statistics.
- Mode: It is the number which occurs most frequently in the data series. It is robust and not affected by the couple of new values.

--------
- Mean: It is the average of the numbers in the data series. It is not robust.

--------
- Median: The absolute central value of the data series is called median.

-----
- Outliers: Any value will fall really outside the range of the data is termed as a outlier.
  - Reasons for Outliers in the data.
1. Typos.
2. Measurement error.
3. Intentional error.
4. Legit outliers.
- Mean gets affected by Outliers while Mode not.
### Spread of Data.
- Spread of Data describes how similar or varied are the set of observations.

-----
1. Range: The difference between the smallest and largest values is called range. The bigger the range the more spread out is the data. It is not very robust metric to calculate spread of data. It takes the entire data into consideration.

------
2. Inter Quartile Range(IQR): It is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. It is not affected by just a few outliers in the data. It takes 50% of the data into consideration.

------
3. Variance: It is the average squared deviations from the mean. The formula is given below.

-----
4. Standard Deviation: It is the square root of variance.

------
- Frequency Table: A table representing frequency or a count of a category.
------
- Probability: Number of changes a particular event will occur.

### Bernoulli Trials.
- An experiment which has exactly two outcomes. Probability distribution of the number of successes in 'n' Bernoulli Trials is called as Binomial Distriburtion.

Here, p = probability of winning,
      1-p = q = probability of loosing,
      n = number of times an event occur,
      k = number of times of winning.

### Continuous Random Variable.
